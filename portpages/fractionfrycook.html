                   <p><big><strong>Team members</strong></big><br>Paloma Fernandez, Justin Park, Nancy Nguyen (me!)<br><br><big><strong>Timeline of project</strong></big><br>May 2019 - June 2019<br><br><big><strong>My roles</strong></big><br>UX/UI/Visual Design, UX Researcher<br><br><big><strong>Problem statement</strong></big><br>Kids often find it difficult to stay engaged while learning new or difficult subjects.<br><br><big><strong>Design challenge</strong></big><br>How might we introduce fractions to kids in educational settings such as schools and museums in a way that keeps them engaged?<br><br><big><strong>Needfinding</strong></big><br>Our kiosk wasn't about fractions in the beginning! At first, we wanted to focus on other STEM subjects that relied on math, such as Physics and Chemistry. Due to this, we began our needfinding by interviewing kids between ages 12 to 16 since they are currently being exposed to these subjects. <br><br><i><strong>We interviewed four kids with the following interview guide:</strong></i> <br>  1. What subject(s) are you most reluctant to learn?<br>2. What would you change about the subject you are most reluctant to learn?<br>3. What learning strategy/strategies work(s) best for you?<br><br>Our participants included two 12 year olds (Annie + Julia), one 15 year old (Emily), and one 16 year old (James).<br><br><center><img src="/img/interview1-results.png" width="85%"></center>Due to time constraints, we only interviewed children since they were our target audience. After collecting feedback from our evaluators concerning this, we conducted a second round of needfinding interviews with other stakeholders (parents and teachers).<br><br>Our participants were a 3rd grade teacher (Jane), a 3rd + 4th grader, and a parent.<br><center><img src="/img/interview2-results.png" width="85%"></center><strong>Key takeaways from both rounds of needfinding</strong>: The teachers' learning approaches did not completely match what kids needed in order to grasp concepts well. Kids typically are visual learners, finding it easier to learn the concepts and work out the problems if it is drawn out.<br><br>After conducting our second needfinding session, our team decided to pivot. Instead of focusing on complex subjects, we wanted to focus on fractions because they are a vital part of equations in physics, chemistry, and calculus. Having a firm grasp on fractions will assist greatly in those respective subjects.<br><br><big><strong>Ideation</strong></big><br>To guide us through our design challenge, we uncovered the following pain points and transformed them into opportunities:<br>- How might we encourage kids to want to learn fractions?<br>- How might we keep them engaged while learning fractions?<br>- How might we adjust to their different learning needs?<br><br><big><strong>Our solution</strong></big><br> Create an engaging, immersive experience for kids to practice visually tackling fractions using real world concepts while attending to their custom learning needs. The experience will be embedded in a kiosk with a VR accessory.<br><br>The kiosk itself is a math-based cooking activity. The user picks from the recipe selection menu, view the recipe and ingredients, and head to the market to purchase those ingredients. Afterwards, the user will engage in several multiple choice questions on how to turn their ingredients into the correct amount for the required serving size, utilizing fractions.<br><br></p>
