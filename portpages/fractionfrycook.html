                   <p><big><strong>Team members</strong></big><br>Paloma Fernandez, Justin Park, Nancy Nguyen (me!)<br><br><big><strong>Timeline of project</strong></big><br>May 2019 - June 2019<br><br><big><strong>My roles</strong></big><br>UX/UI/Visual Design, UX Researcher<br><br><big><strong>Problem statement</strong></big><br>Kids often find it difficult to stay engaged while learning new or difficult subjects.<br><br><big><strong>Design challenge</strong></big><br>How might we introduce fractions to kids in educational settings such as schools and museums in a way that keeps them engaged?<br><br><big><strong>Needfinding</strong></big><br>Our kiosk wasn't about fractions in the beginning! At first, we wanted to focus on other STEM subjects that relied on math, such as Physics and Chemistry. Due to this, we began our needfinding by interviewing kids between ages 12 to 16 since they are currently being exposed to these subjects. <br><br><i><strong>We interviewed four kids with the following interview guide:</strong></i> <br>  1. What subject(s) are you most reluctant to learn?<br>2. What would you change about the subject you are most reluctant to learn?<br>3. What learning strategy/strategies work(s) best for you?<br><br>Our participants included two 12 year olds (Annie + Julia), one 15 year old (Emily), and one 16 year old (James).<br><br><center><img src="/img/interview1-results.png" width="85%"></center>Due to time constraints, we only interviewed children since they were our target audience. After collecting feedback from our evaluators concerning this, we conducted a second round of needfinding interviews with other stakeholders (parents and teachers).<br><br>Our participants were a 3rd grade teacher (Jane), a 3rd + 4th grader, and a parent.<br><center><img src="/img/interview2-results.png" width="85%"></center><strong>Key takeaways from both rounds of needfinding</strong>: The teachers' learning approaches did not completely match what kids needed in order to grasp concepts well. Kids typically are visual learners, finding it easier to learn the concepts and work out the problems if it is drawn out.<br><br>After conducting our second needfinding session, our team decided to pivot. Instead of focusing on complex subjects, we wanted to focus on fractions because they are a vital part of equations in physics, chemistry, and calculus. Having a firm grasp on fractions will assist greatly in those respective subjects.<br><br><big><strong>Ideation</strong></big><br>To guide us through our design challenge, we uncovered the following pain points and transformed them into opportunities:<br>- How might we encourage kids to want to learn fractions?<br>- How might we keep them engaged while learning fractions?<br>- How might we adjust to their different learning needs?<br>- How can we help them learn fractions using real world applications?<br><br><img src="/img/IMG_1449.jpeg" style="float:left"; width="50%"><img src="/img/IMG_1451.jpeg" style="float:right"; width="50%"><br><br><big><strong>Our solution</strong></big><br> Create an engaging, immersive experience for kids to practice visually tackling fractions using real world concepts while attending to their custom learning needs. The experience will be embedded in a kiosk with a VR accessory.<br><br><big><strong>User Flowchart</strong></big><br><center><img src="/img/ff_userflow1.png" width="75%"></center>The kiosk itself is a math-based cooking activity. The user picks from the recipe selection menu, views the recipe and ingredients, and heads to the market to purchase those ingredients. Afterwards, the user will engage in several multiple choice questions on how to turn their ingredients into the correct amount for the required serving size, utilizing fractions. Once the user correctly fractions up their ingredients for the listed serving size, they can start physically preparing the recipe in VR.<br><br><big><strong>Screens</strong></big><br><br><center><img src="/img/ff_screens.png" width="80%"></center><br><big><strong>Style Guide</strong></big><br><center><img src="/img/ff_sg.png" width="60%"></center><br>Our chosen color palette felt appropriate for our target age group (7-10 year olds). Being a cooking-related product, the colors resembling fresh produce help represent the activity. Cocogoose was our selected typeface because of its rounded and playful nature, yet it holds the ability to be easily readable.<br><br><big><strong>User Testing + Feedback - Kiosk</strong></big><br>Our final showcase for our class, Design 100: Prototyping, was held in order to conduct user tests and collect feedback. <strong>Some issues users had were:</strong><br><br><center><img src="/img/ff_error1.png" width="80%"></center><br><strong>Our solutions for these errors in future iterations are:</strong><br>- Increase the stroke size of the highlighted selection or change it to a more contrasting color.<br>- Change the arrow button to an oblong shaped button that says "Continue" or "Next".<br>- Allow scrolling, or add more white space to the bottom of the list so users would not see signifiers for scrolling ability.<br><br><big><strong>Future Direction</strong></big><br>After fixing usability errors and improving graphics, we want to implement a level adjustment option so that users can decide how challenging they want the activity to be in order to adjust to their different learning needs. Additionally, we want to fully develop the app and integrate VR as a major component rather than an accessory to allow collaboration between co-located users and open the possibility of it existing inside school settings and childrens' museums, such as the Discovery Cube in Los Angeles.<br><br><big><strong>Challenges We Ran Into</strong></big><br>As the timeline of our project was quite short, we were not able to interview many adult stakeholders (such as teachers and museum administrators). Since our interviewees were mostly children within our targeted age range (7-10), bias may have occurred as a result. If allowed more time, we definitely would have gathered adequate amounts of information from older stakeholders to lead our design decisions.<br><br>Time was a large factor in our prototyping stage as well. Our original goal was to have the VR system integrated synchronously with the kiosk to allow multiple users at once, further gamifying the kiosk and encouraging collaboration with peers. We were not able to accomplish this goal due to its complex coding requirements that wouldn't be possible with our time allotment.<br><br>Our prototype was completely made in Figma, which does not account for user input. Users of our kiosk did not have the ability to adjust the difficulty levels, which in turn affected our goal of adjusting to the user's learning needs.<br><br><big><strong>Key Takeaways from the Experience</strong></big><br>I learned that people of all ages can really enjoy learning visually, and many prefer to do so! To my surprise, a lot of people my age and older (college students and professors) still had trouble with fractions and really needed a visual to think about  and understand them. Making fractions fun and interactive in a simulation helps not only kids to stay engaged, but adults as well!<br><br><big><strong>Fraction Frycook Prototype - <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/MMNMtRR03raluBOKFpDoMuRO/DSGN-100-A4-Screens?node-id=6%3A0&scaling=scale-down"><u>Figma Link</u></a></strong></big><br><br><big><strong>Physical Kiosk</strong></big> (Made by Paloma) <strong><big>+ VR Component</big></strong> (Made by Justin)<br><img src="/img/ff_kiosk.jpg"style="float:left"; width="50%"><img src="/img/ff_vr.gif" style="float:right"; width="45%"></p>
