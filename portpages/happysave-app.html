                     <big><b>Team Members</b></big><br>Jason Ding, Cody Smith, and Nancy Nguyen (me!)<br><br><big><b>Timeline</b></big><br>January - March, 2019<br><br><big><b>My Role</b></big><br>UI/UX Design, Project Management, User Research, Front-End Development<br><br><big><b>Problem Statement</b></big><br>Food waste is no stranger to college students. Oftentimes, hectic schedules get in the way, causing potholes in budgets and groceries left forgotten in the back of the fridge. This disrupts the student's budgeting and contributes to greenhouse gases from food waste, a major issue that is impacting our environment on a global scale (<u><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/10/thirty-percent-world-food-wasted-2014103192739208584.html">about 1/3 of global food production is wasted every year</a></u>).<br><br><big><b>The Design Challenge</b></big><br>How might we design a budgeting app that zones in on food waste for busy young professionals (aged 18-25)?<br><br><big><b>Needfinding</b></big><br>Noticing how often college students (such as our friends, roommates, and selves) purchase groceries and forget about them in the back of the fridge until they go bad, we attempted to dissect the possible reasons behind it. We conducted preliminary interviews with five UCSD students.<br><br>During these interviews, we asked participants the following six questions:<br><br>- How often do you grocery shop/eat out per week?<br>- How much do you typically spend on groceries per week? How about eating out?<br>- How important is it for you to budget with your meals and stick to it? Explain why.<br>- How often does your schedule interfere with meal planning? Explain why.<br>- Has there ever been a time where your groceries have gone bad before use?<br>- Is food sustainability a priority for you in your daily life? Why or why not?<br><br><big><b>Storyboards
                     </b></big><br><img src="/img/sb.png" width="100%"><br><br><big><b>Ideation</b></big><br><br><big><b>Our solution</b></big><br>An app where users can set and adjust their budget for a certain time period, list the ingredients they have at home to view whenever and wherever, create shopping lists, and get tips on how to save money and reduce food waste. The user's spending and food waste data will be displayed to them so they can continuously keep track of their habits.<br><br>The app will have a minimalistic feel with light colors to accomodate for the user's busy lifestyle.<br><br><big><b>User Flow Chart</b></big><br><center><img src="/img/hs_userflow.png" width="75%"></center><br><br><big><b>Design System</b></big><br><center><img src="/img/dlHS.png" width="100%"></center><br><big><b>User testing + Interviews</b></big><br><br><big><b>A/B testing</b></big><br><br><br><b><big>Future Direction</big></b><br>Happy Save was implemented in a short amount of time. In the future, we would improve it in many ways and extend its list of functions.<br><br>Beginning with the UI, we would improve it by making it more professional/clean and seamless through the implementation of grid, changing of the design language to a more appropriate one (different color scheme and typeface), and iteration of UI elements (buttons and text). Additionally, we wish to install AI support within the app to accurately provide money saving tips to users based on their spending habits.<br><br>A function we were not able to add in during the class was the implementation of Google Maps API to show users stores nearby that were having sales on certain items they added to their shopping list or other areas of the app, so we would love to add that in a future iteration!<br><br><b><big>Challenges We Ran Into</big></b><br>Originally, we had planned to create an environment in the app that shows a fridge with the inputted food on the shelves. The fridge would be embedded in the Food part of the app and it would be fully interactive and allow the user to visualize what they have in their “fridge”. Due to time constraints, we were not able to design and code this idea, so our app transformed into one that uses lists instead of images.<br><br>In the first prototype, our team designed a function that would allow users to input their eating out habits and have their spending data displayed to them along with the groceries portion. This function did not appear in the final prototype, but we hope that we can install it in a future iteration.<br><br>Due to our small team of 3, some development goals could not be reached during the 10-week period, unfortunately.
