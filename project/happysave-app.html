                     <h3>Team Members</h3>Jason Ding, Cody Smith<br><br>
                     
                     <h3>Timeline</h3>January - March, 2019 (10 weeks)<br><br>
                     
                     <h3>My Role</h3>UI/UX Design, Project Management, User Research, Front-End Development<br><br>
                     
                    <h3>The Problem</h3>Food waste is no stranger to college students. Oftentimes, hectic schedules get in the way, causing potholes in budgets and groceries left forgotten in the back of the fridge. This disrupts the student's budgeting and contributes to greenhouse gases from food waste, a major issue that is impacting our environment on a global scale (<u><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/10/thirty-percent-world-food-wasted-2014103192739208584.html">about 1/3 of global food production is wasted every year</a></u>).<br><br>
                     
                     <h3>The Design Challenge</h3>How might we design a budgeting app that zones in on food waste for busy young professionals (aged 18-25)?<br><br>
                     
                     <h3>Needfinding</h3>Noticing how often college students (such as our friends, roommates, and selves) purchase groceries and forget about them in the back of the fridge until they go bad, we attempted to dissect the possible reasons behind it. We conducted preliminary interviews with three UCSD students.<br><br>During these interviews, we asked participants the following four questions:<br><br>- How important is it for you to budget with your meals and stick to it? Explain why.<br>- How often does your schedule interfere with meal planning? Explain why.<br>- How often do your groceries go bad before you are able to use them?<br>- Is food sustainability a priority for you in your daily life? Why or why not?<img src="/img/hsir.png" width="100%">
                     
                    <h3>Storyboards</h3>In order to summarize our research findings, we created three different storyboards that captured separate user journeys and experiences through each unique issue.<br><br><img src="/img/sb.png" width="100%"><br><br>
                     
                     <h3>Ideation</h3>To reach our solution, we translated the pain points discovered in our interviews into opportunities:<br><br>
- How might we help users shop smarter at the grocery store?<br>
- How might we encourage users to reduce food waste? <br>
- How can we allow users to view what ingredients they have at home?
<br><br>
                     
<h3>Our Solution</h3>An app where users can set and adjust their budget for a certain time period, list the ingredients they have at home to view whenever and wherever, create shopping lists, and get tips on how to save money and reduce food waste. The user's spending and food waste data will be displayed to them so they can continuously keep track of their habits.<br><br>The app will have a minimalistic feel with light colors to accomodate for the user's busy lifestyle.<br><br>
 
<h3>Prototyping</h3>We began our prototyping journey by creating two different low fidelity prototypes on paper in order to immediately visualize and test our ideas.<br><img src="/img/pp1_hs.png" width="100%"><br><br><img src="/img/pp2_hs.png" width="100%"><br>Our team performed Wizard-of-Oz prototyping with several users to receive feedback and identify potential usability errors through heuristic evaluation. Using the Nielsen Norman Group's usability heuristics for UI Design, we were able to pinpoint pain points and effectively solve them prior to the development stage of our app.<br><br>After testing both paper prototypes, we ultimately decided to move forward with number two. This decision was in part due to the limited amount of time left for the development stage of the class (COGS 120: Interaction Design).

<h3>User Flowchart</h3><center><img src="/img/hs_userflow.png" width="100%"></center><br>After the user logs in to their account, they can take three different routes. The <strong>"Wallet" </strong>is where users can set their budget, input the costs of items they've bought, and receive tips on how to save money based on their spending patterns.<br><br>In the <strong>"Kitchen"</strong>, users can input what they have in their actual fridge and pantry along with their expiration dates. Once an item expires and it is not used up (amount used is inputted by users) it will go into the <strong>"Waste" </strong>portion.<br><br>The <strong>"Shopping List"</strong> function allows users to add items they need to buy and delete them when purchased.<br><br>

                     <h3>User Testing + Interviews</h3>Check back very soon for this section! In the meantime, feel free to contact me regarding the qualitative data.<br><br>
                     
                     <h3>A/B Testing</h3>Check back very soon for this section as well!<br><br>
            
                     <h3>Screens</h3><br><img src="/img/screenshs.png" width="100%">
                        <br><br>
                     
                     <h3>Challenges We Ran Into</h3>Originally, we had planned to create a shared environment in the app that shows items users (such as roommates) shared with each other. This way, users could communicate with one another about what they already had in the fridge and what they need to repurchase. Due to time constraints, we were not able to develop this idea.<br><br>In the original paper prototype, our team designed a function that would allow users to input their eating out data and have their spending data displayed to them along with the groceries portion. This section of the application did not make an appearance in the final prototype due to a limited development period, but we hope that we can install it in a future iteration.
            
<br><br><h3>What I Learned</h3>1. How to create accurate development plans under time constraints.<br>2. Paper prototyping and Wizard-of-Oz techniques really help minimize development overhead.<br><br>
            
            <h3>Future Direction</h3>Happy Save was implemented in a short amount of time. In the future, we would improve it in many ways and extend its list of functions.<br><br>We would prioritize improving the process of adding items to your "Fridge" and "Shopping List" by implementing autocomplete suggestions so that users do not have to manually input everything, making it more efficient and less tedious. Additionally, we wish to install AIs within the app to accurately provide money saving tips to users based on their spending habits.<br><br>A function we were not able to add in during the class was the implementation of Google Maps API to show users stores nearby that were having sales on certain items they added to their shopping list or other areas of the app, so we would love to add that in a future iteration!<br><br>
